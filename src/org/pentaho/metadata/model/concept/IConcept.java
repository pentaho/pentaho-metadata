/**
 * this is the root container for Pentaho Metadata. Metadata objects are concepts, and concepts may have properties.
 * 
 * Concepts have three forms of inheritance
 * 
 * - the first form is inherit, which is derived from the relationships of the metadata objects.
 * 
 * - the second form is parent concept, which may be explicitly configured in the UI
 * 
 * - the third form is security parent, which is derived from the relationships of the metadata objects and only applies
 * to the security types.
 * 
 * In addition to inheritance, concepts act as the base objects for all other metadata model objects. These model
 * objects reflect their structural relationships in a generic way, so that tools like LocalizationUtil can easily
 * reference via uniqueID all objects within a model. The methods getParent() and getChildren() are used to generically
 * access these predefined relationships.
